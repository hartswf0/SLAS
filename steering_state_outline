#STEERING LIKE A STATE

I. Introduction

This paper uses historical cybernetics analysis to address pressing debates around algorithmic governance, AI ethics, and regulatory models for advanced technologies emerging today. By analyzing the paradoxes that arose in each era regarding control, autonomy, abstraction, and knowledge hierarchies, the paper extracts principles for ethically "steering" AI systems without oversteering into techno-dystopias. 

Tracing the influence of cybernetic ideas across history, while grounding it in contemporary issues around AI governance, this paper explores cybernetics' philosophical foundations with Wiener, its radical application to national governance in Allende's Chile via Stafford Beerâ€™s Viable System model, and its corporate embodiment in today's tech giants like Google. This paper reaffirms cybernetics' continuing value for governing emerging technologies, tempered by an appreciation for ambiguity and avoiding reductive myths of technological control.

Thesis: Cybernetic principles offer a framework for reimagining state governance, but their application faces inherent paradoxes and limitations.

INTRO_1. The Importance of Experience in Navigating Complex Systems
    A. The River's Secret: The Unspoken Knowledge of Local Pilots
        - Riverboat pilots possess invaluable, localized knowledge gained through experience, which is crucial for navigation and often superior to general, codified rules.
    B. Steering Through Life: When Experience Beats Brilliance
        - Experience in various conditions often trumps theoretical knowledge in practical applications.
    C. Piloting the State
        - Why did Chile entrust its governance to Stafford Beer, who, like a pilot relying solely on textbook knowledge, had never before realistically "piloted" a country?

INTRO_2. Understanding the Importance of Localized Knowledge and Skills
    A. The Lost Art of Navigation: Steering through the Unseen Costs of Cybernetic Management
        - Centralized and standardized knowledge democratizes certain skills.
        - This often inadvertently destroys localized knowledge, crucial for certain forms of production and social life, for the sake of control and appropriation.
    B. Navigating the Factory Floor: The Unseen Challenge of Steering Factory Operations
        - Individual skills of machine operators, similar to understanding the unique quirks of driving an old car, are crucial for effective factory operations.
        - These skills are important despite the job being classified as "unskilled."

INTRO_3. Control and Adaptability in Crisis Management
    A. Steering the Unsteerable: The Delusion of Absolute Control
        - Administrators often perceive their control as absolute in calm times. However, during times of upheaval, it becomes apparent that this control is often an illusion as the system moves independently.
    B. Rules of Thumb in the Eye of the Storm: Metis in Emergency Response
        - Emergency response specialists rely on a combination of taught guidelines and the ability to improvise. The nature of each crisis is unique, necessitating adaptability alongside foundational knowledge.

INTRO_4. Navigating through High-Stakes and Unpredictable Situations
    A. Unpredictable Seas: Navigating the High-Stakes Game of Revolution
        - War diplomacy and politics function similarly to sailing, requiring swift adaptation to unpredictable events and optimal use of limited resources.
    B. Applying Prudent Small Steps to the Project of Democratic Socialism
        - In complex tasks such as democratic socialism, each step, based on prior experience, generates unpredictable outcomes that guide subsequent steps.
